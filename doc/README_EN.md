## 🖥️ Desktop Client

> Removed web-specific features such as various login verifications and session suspension.

https://github.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/releases/latest

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Configure Environment

> It is recommended to deploy in a Debian (AMD64 architecture) environment. Since I do not have an ARM device, compatibility with ARM is not guaranteed.

Create a new folder

```bash
mkdir ./nexus-terminal && cd ./nexus-terminal
```

---

Download the [**docker-compose.yml**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) and [**.env**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/.env) files from the repository to your current directory.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml -O docker-compose.yml && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/refs/heads/main/.env -O .env
```

> ⚠️ **Note:**
>
> - For **arm64** users, replace `guacamole/guacd:latest` with `guacamole/guacd:1.6.0-RC1` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
> - For **armv7** users, please refer to the additional notes below.

Configure nginx

```conf
location / {
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header Range $http_range;
    proxy_set_header If-Range $http_if_range;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18111;
}
```

Configure IPv6 for Docker (optional — you can skip this if you don't use IPv6 to connect to the server).

Add the following content to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/80",
  "ip6tables": true,
  "experimental": true
}
```

Then restart the Docker service:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Service

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3️⃣ Update

Note: Running with docker-compose does not require pulling the source code unless you plan to build it yourself. Simply execute the following commands in the project directory to update.

```bash
docker compose down
```

```bash
docker compose pull
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 📚 Usage Guide

### Suspend Session Component

You can right-click in the SSH tab to select "Suspend Session" (long-press on mobile). Once suspended, even if the web connection is lost, the backend will automatically take over and keep the SSH connection active. You can resume the session at any time via the panel. This ensures that tasks such as compilation or long-running processes won’t be interrupted due to network issues.

### Command Input Component

1.  **Tab Switching**: When the command input box has focus, use `Alt + ↑/↓` to switch between SSH session tabs, and `Alt + ←/→` to switch between text editor tabs.
2.  **Command Sync** (needs to be enabled in settings): When enabled, text entered in the command input box will be synchronized in real-time to the selected target input source. Use the `↑/↓` keys to select menu command items, then press `Enter` to send the selected command.

### File Manager Component

1.  **Quick File Selection**: When the file search box has focus, you can use the `↑/↓` keys to quickly select files.
2.  **Drag and Drop Upload**: Supports dragging files or folders from outside the browser for uploading. **Note:** When uploading a large number of files or deeply nested folders, it is recommended to compress them first to avoid browser freezes.
3.  **Internal Drag and Drop**: You can directly drag and drop files or folders within the file manager to move them.
4.  **Multiple Selection**: Hold down the `Ctrl` or `Shift` key to select multiple files or folders.
5.  **Context Menu**: Provides common file operations such as copy, paste, cut, delete, rename, and modify permissions.

### Command History Component

1.  **View Full Command**: When a historical command is too long and truncated, hover the mouse over the command to view the complete instruction content.

### Terminal Component

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + C** to copy, and **Ctrl + Shift + V** to paste.

### General Operations

1.  **Zoom**: In the terminal, file manager, text editor components, and quick command view, you can use `Ctrl + mouse wheel` to zoom.
2.  **Sidebar**: The expanded sidebar can have its width adjusted by dragging.
3.  **Tab Bar**: Right-clicking on the SSH tab bar or the file manager tab bar will open a context menu with the following options: Close, Close Tabs to the Left, Close Other Tabs, and Close Tabs to the Right.
4.  **Tab Group Fold Bar**: You can directly click on the tab name in the view to rename the tab.
5.  **Automatic Reconnection**: When the connection is lost, you can press Enter in the command input box or terminal, or click the same SSH connection in the connection list to trigger automatic reconnection.

### Batch Command Execution Component

1. **Select Servers**: In the batch execution panel, check the SSH connections you want to execute commands on, with support for select all/deselect all
2. **Enter Command**: Type the command to execute in the command input box, with sudo mode support
3. **Concurrency Control**: Adjust the concurrency limit (default 5) to control the number of simultaneous tasks
4. **Real-time Progress**: View each server's status and overall progress during execution
5. **View Output**: Click the "View" button to see the command output for individual servers
6. **Cancel Task**: Cancel all uncompleted tasks at any time during execution

### AI Smart Assistant Component

1. **Quick Queries**: Click preset suggestions to quickly query system health, command patterns, security events, etc.
2. **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions directly, and the AI assistant will analyze and return relevant data
3. **Session History**: Click the history button to view and restore previous sessions
4. **Smart Insights**: AI automatically generates actionable suggestions, categorized by severity level

### Others

1. **On mobile devices, you can zoom in or out on the terminal font using a two-finger gesture.**
2. To enable Passkey login, set the `RP_ID` and `RP_ORIGIN` environment variables in the `.env` file.

## ⚠️ Notes

1.  **Dual File Managers**: You can add two file manager components in the layout (experimental feature, may be unstable).
2.  **Multiple Text Editors**: The functionality to add multiple text editors in the same layout has not yet been implemented.
3.  For **ARMv7** users, please use the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Silentely/nexus-terminal/blob/main/doc/arm/docker-compose.yml) provided here.
    Since Apache Guacamole does not provide an ARMv7-compatible image for `guacd`, the RDP/VNC feature has been disabled, and related images will not be pulled for now.
4.  Since I don't have an ARM machine on hand, I haven't conducted actual testing, so unexpected bugs may occur during runtime.
5.  For data backup, please back up the **data** folder in the directory yourself. This project does not provide any backup functionality.
